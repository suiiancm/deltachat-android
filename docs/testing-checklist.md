# Testing checklist

Only some rough ideas, ideally, this should result into a simple checklist
that can be checked before releasing.
However, although it would be nice to test "everything", we should keep in mind
that the test should be doable in, say, 10~15 minutes.
- create new account with (one of?): gmail, yandex, other
  or (?) test an existing account
- send and receive a message
- create a group
- do a contact verification
- join a group via a qr scan
