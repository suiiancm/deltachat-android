Chat over e-mail. Elegant, encrypted, without tracking: Privacy by Design.

# Full description (max. 4000 characters)

Delta Chat looks and feels like other popular messenger apps, 
but does not involve centralized control or tracking. 
Technically, Delta Chat is an e-mail application with a modern chat interface. 
E-Mail in a new dress if you will. 
All chat data is stored like your regular e-mail only. 
No Addressbook or other personal data is going anywhere. 
There simply are no Delta Chat servers where anything could go to. 

Use Delta Chat with anyone out of billions of people: just use their e-mail address. 
It's fine if your contacts answer with their own mail program. 
They don't need to install Delta Chat or visit some website. 
If you send a picture, audio message or document to a Chat group 
your chat recipients will see a nice regular e-mail with an attachment. 
If they send a message or picture back, you will see it in your Chat 
for this contact. It's that simple. 

Delta Chat sends e-mails using your e-mail account and provider of choice. 
Your mobile number does not matter. You don't need to have a mobile
number in order to use Delta Chat and you can change numbers without 
causing any trouble for Delta Chat. You can export all your Chat data
on one device, import it on a new device and happily continue chatting. 

Delta Chat establishes end-to-end encryption automatically as soon as
chat participants start communicating with each other. 
On a two-people chat, just send a "Hi!" message and you will receive 
an encrypted reply already.  Your Chat is now end-to-end encrypted.

End-to-End encryption not only happens between Delta Chat apps, but also
when messaging with other e-mail apps if they support the Autocrypt Level 1 
encryption standard. Moreover, Delta Chat offers an experimental
"verified group" chat that guarantees end-to-end encryption to be secure
against active network or provider attacks. This unique, experimental
feature is based on recent usability and cryptographic research and is
going to be refined after further user-testing with at-risk users in 2019.

Delta Chat offers instant chatting and synchronization across devices. 
Messages sent on one device will quickly show up on other devices.  
There is an early iPhone version and downloads for Linux and Mac OS Laptops. 
Windows support is in the works. All Desktop versions can be used standalone.
There is no need to have an Android or iPhone setup. 

Delta Chat is a relatively young project, but already has a lot to offer. 
It employs a pragmatic and usability-driven approach to decentralized messaging. 
No re-inventing of wheels unless one of them causes actual trouble or concern. 
We rather often think about removing technology than adding yet more of it, 
trying to keep things maintainable and understandable for us and others. 
Most popular programming languages and many human languages are involved
in the development of Delta Chat apps and the various activities around it. 

We are grateful for any help, be it contributing good bug reports, helping
other users on the forum, participating in our open development with PRs and reviews, 
translations to more languages, working on new bots, setting up new experimental mail servers ... 
or a donation if you can. 

We currently use monetary donations to help contributors join us at our
repeated one-week long gatherings -- where we develop and user-test with
locals and evolve new directions and plans.
