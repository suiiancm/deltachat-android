Delta Chat feels like Whatsapp or Telegram but does not involve centralized control
or tracking. How comes? Delta Chat is technically an e-mail application 
but looks like a modern chat interface.  E-Mail in a new dress if you will. 
All data is stored on your devices only.  No Addressbook or other personal data is going anywhere. 
There simply are no Delta Chat servers where anything could go to. 

Chat with anyone out of billions of people: just use their e-mail address. 
It's fine if your contacts answer with their own mail program. 
They don't need to install Delta Chat or visit some website. 
If you send a picture, audio message or document to a Chat group 
your chat recipients will see a nice regular e-mail with an attachment. 
If they send a picture or document back, you will see it in your Chat 
for this contact. It's that simple. 

DeltaChat sends e-mails using your e-mail account and provider of choice. 
Your mobile number does not matter. You don't need to have a mobile
number in order to use DeltaChat and you can change mobile numbers without 
causing any trouble for DeltaChat. You can export all your Chat data
on one device, import it on a new device and happily continue chatting. 

DeltaChat offers instant chatting and synchronization across devices. 
Messages sent on one device will quickly show up on other devices.  
There is an early iPhone version and downloads for Linux and Mac OS Laptops. 
Windows support is in the works. All Desktop versions can be used standalone.
There is no need to have an Android or iPhone setup. 

Delta Chat is a relatively young project for what it offers already. 
It employs a pragmatic and usability-driven approach to decentralized messaging. 
No re-inventing of wheel technology unless it causes actual trouble or concern. 
Most popular programming languages and many human languages are involved
in the development of Delta Chat apps and the various activities around it. 
We rather often think about removing technology than adding yet more of it. 
Trying to keep things maintainable and understandable. 

We are grateful for any help, be it contributing good bug reports, helping
other users on the forum, participating in our open development with PRs and reviews, 
translations to more languages, working on new bots, setting up new experimental 
mail servers ... or a donation if you can. 
We currently use donations to enable contributors to join us at our repeated one-week 
long gatherings -- where we develop and user-test with locals and evolve 
new directions and plans.
