Chat over e-mail. Elegantly Retro, Decentralized and Open. Privacy by Design.

# Full description (max. 4000 characters)

Delta Chat looks and feels like other popular messenger apps, 
but does not involve centralized control, tracking or selling
you, friends, colleagues or family out to large organizations. 
"Privacy by Design" has never been more fun. 

Delta Chat taps into the largest, most diverse, most open and decentralized 
communication system ever created: the existing e-mail server network. 
Delta Chat requires no additional server-side infrastructure. Just use a 
standard e-mail account and start chatting with any of your
e-mail contacts, whether they have installed Delta Chat or not. 

Technically, Delta Chat is an e-mail application with a modern chat interface. 
E-Mail in a new dress if you will. Chat and contact data remain on your devices. 
No uploads of Addressbook, calendar or other personal data. There simply are no 
Delta Chat servers where anything could be uploaded to. Privacy by design. 

Use Delta Chat with anyone out of billions of people: just use their e-mail address. 
Recipients will see a simple e-mail and may directly reply with their own e-mail app. 
They don't need to install Delta Chat, visit websites or sign up anywhere. 
If you send a picture or other media to a Chat group your chat recipients 
will see a nice regular e-mail with an attachment. If they send a message 
and attachments back, you will see the media in your Chat for this contact. 

Delta Chat sends e-mails using your e-mail account and provider of choice. 
You can change mobile numbers without any trouble or even work without 
any SIM card at all.  You can export all your Chat data on one device, 
import it on a new device and happily continue chatting. Not requiring 
mobile numbers avoids cell-tower and other tracking. Privacy by Design. 

Delta Chat establishes end-to-end encryption automatically when 
chat partners start communicating with each other. 
On a two-people chat, just send a "Hi!" message and already receive 
an encrypted reply if the other side accepts you as contact. 
End-to-End encryption not only works between Delta Chat apps, but also
with other e-mail apps if they support the Autocrypt Level 1 encryption standard. 

Moreover, Delta Chat offers an experimental "verified group" chat 
guaranteeing end-to-end encryption to be secure against active network 
or provider attacks. This unique feature is based on recent usability 
and cryptographic research and is going to be refined after further user-testing 
with at-risk users in 2019.

Delta Chat offers instant chatting and synchronization across devices. 
Messages sent on one device will quickly show up on other devices.  
There is an early iPhone version and downloads for Linux and Mac OS Laptops. 
Windows support is in the works. All Desktop versions can be used standalone.
No need for an Android or iPhone setup. 

Delta Chat is a relatively young project, but already has a lot to offer. 
It employs a pragmatic and usability-driven approach to decentralized messaging. 
No re-inventing of wheels unless one of them causes actual trouble or concern. 
We rather often think about removing technology than adding yet more of it, 
trying to keep things maintainable and understandable for us and others. 
Most popular programming languages and many human languages are involved
in the development of Delta Chat apps and the various activities around it. 

We are grateful for any help, be it contributing good bug reports, helping
other users on the forum, participating in our open development with PRs and reviews, 
translations to more languages, working on new bots, setting up new experimental mail servers ... 
or a donation if you can. 

We currently use monetary donations to help contributors join us at our
repeated one-week long gatherings -- where we develop and user-test with
locals and evolve new directions and plans.
